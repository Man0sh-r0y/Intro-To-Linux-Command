# Into to Linux Commands

1. `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory.
2. `mkdir`: Create a new Folder in current directory.
    
    ```bash
    mkdir folderName
    ```
    
    Create a subfolder:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir currFolder
    
    mkdir currFolder/subFolder
    ```
    
3. `cd`: Change directory
    
    ```bash
    cd directoryName
    ```
    
4. `cd ..`: Exit the current directory and go back to previous directory
5. `echo`: Built in command in home bin directory. It‚Äôs used to display values and variables in the shell
    
    ```bash
    echo "first" && echo "second"
    ```
    
    Here second will be printed only after the first is printed
    
    When you wanna add multiple commands in the same line, you can use `;` to seperate commands
    
    Example:
    
    ```bash
    whoami;echo "Hello"
    ```
    
    ```bash
    echo "one" || echo "two"
    ```
    
    Here `one` will be printed only
    
    ```bash
    echo "hey" >> file.txt
    ```
    
    This will append `hey` to this file
    
    ```bash
    echo "hey" > file.txt
    ```
    
    This will remove all other contents from the file and only appened `hey` to the file (That‚Äôs mean it will overwrite the file) 
    
    ```bash
    echo "hey" && {echo "hi";echo "I am good"}
    ```
    
    OutPut:

    Find files in the current directory
    
    ```bash
    find .
    ```
    
    Find files in the previous directory
    
    ```bash

    ```bash
    find . -type f

    Find a particular file in the current directory with its name (Here the name of the file is case sensitive)
    
    ```bash
    find . -type f -name "fileName.txt"
    ```
    
    Suppose if I want to find files with the name ‚Äútwo‚Äù, then we will do this below code. Here `*` means anything can come over here.
    
    ```bash
    find . -type f -name "two*"
    ```
    
    If I don‚Äôt want the name to be case sensitive then we will use this

    ```
    
    Find files modified less than 20 minutes ago in the current directory

27. File permissions: Linux uses permissions to control who can access files and what actions they can perform.
    
    There are three types of file permission:
    
    - Read (r)
    - Write (w)
    - Execute (x)
    
    To check the permission alloted to a file
    
    ```bash
    ls -l file.txt
    ```
    
    Changing file permissions: You can use `chmod` command to change file permissions.
    Example: `chmod 644 file.txt` (gives read and write permission to the owner, and read-only permission to group and others)
    
    ```bash
    chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r file.txt
    ```
    
    - `u` stand for User
    - `g` stands for group
    - `o` stands for other
    
    <aside>
        
    üìå Here I‚Äôm giving Read (r), Write (w) and Execute (x) permission to User, Read (r) and Execute (x) permission to Group, Read (r) only permission to Other
    
    </aside>
    
    If you want to use numbers instead of u, g, x then 
    
    - `4` stands for Read
    - `2` stands for write
    - `1` stands for execute
    - `0` stands for no permission
    - `7` stands for all Read, write and execute permission
    
    If I want to use numbers instead of u, g, x for the above written command
    
    ```bash
    chmod 754 file.txt
    ```
    
28. `chown`: Change file ownership.
    
    ```bash
    chown new_owner file.txt
    ```
    
29. `whoami`: It‚Äôs used to check which person is logged in and display the name
30. Performing an action on multiple files: Use wildcards like `*` to perform actions on multiple files simultaneously.
    
    ```bash
    rm *.txt
    ```
    
    Here I am removing all files with ".txt" extension
    
    Remove multiple files of type .txt at the same time from the current directory
    
    ```bash
    find . -type f -name "*.txt" -exec rm -rf {} +
    ```
    
31. `grep`: Search for a specific pattern in a file. (It‚Äôs case sensitive)
    
    ```bash
    grep "search_term" file.txt
    ```
    
    Checking the version of the `grep`
    
    ```bash
    grep -V
    ```
    
    ```bash
    grep -w "writePattern" file.txt
    ```
    
    Show (Search) the complete word in the file
    
    Suppose in the file, I have saved my name: Manash Roy. I will give only Mana or Manash It‚Äôll show me complete name
    
    ```bash
    grep -w "Mana" file.txt
    ```
    
    As this `grep` is case sensitive so we will use below command
    
    ```bash
    grep -i "writePattern" file.txt
    ```
    
    ```bash
    grep -iw "writePattern" file.txt
    ```
    
    Find the line number with text
    
    ```bash
    grep -n "searchPattern" file.txt
    ```
    
    Combining all the three types `grep` commands
    
    ```bash
    grep -win "searchPattern" file.txt
    ```
    
    To see the previous three lines we can write
    
    ```bash
    grep -B 3 "searchPattern" file.txt
    ```
    
    To search for the pattern in all the text files of the current directory, we can write
    
    ```bash
    grep -win "searchPattern" ./*.txt
    ```
    
    Check all the files containing some pattern in the current directory
    
    ```bash
    grep -wirl "pattern" .
    ```
